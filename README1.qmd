# UCI HAR Dataset - Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to clean, process, and analyze a dataset with R, while adhering to the principles of tidy data. The dataset consists of data collected from the accelerometers of the **Samsung Galaxy S smartphone** and contains measurements of various physical activities performed by subjects.

The analysis performed includes:
- Merging the training and test datasets.
- Extracting the mean and standard deviation of measurements.
- Assigning descriptive activity names to the dataset.
- Labeling variables with descriptive names.
- Creating a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in this Repository

- **run_analysis.R**: An R script that performs the data analysis, including merging datasets, extracting relevant variables, renaming activities, labeling the dataset, and creating the tidy dataset.
- **CodeBook.md**: A detailed explanation of the variables, data, and transformations applied during the analysis.
- **tidy_data.txt**: The final tidy dataset, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project and how to use the code.

## Steps Performed in `run_analysis.R`

### Merging the Training and Test Datasets
The training and test datasets were combined into one large dataset, consisting of both measurements and activity labels.

### Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements
Only the measurements related to the mean and standard deviation of sensor data were extracted, focusing on relevant features such as:
- `tBodyAcc-mean-X`
- `tBodyAcc-std-Y`
- `fBodyGyro-mean-Z`

### Assigning Descriptive Activity Names
The activity labels (1-6) were replaced with descriptive names, as defined in the **activity_labels.txt** file.

### Appropriately Labeling the Dataset
The dataset was labeled with descriptive variable names corresponding to the measurements, such as `tBodyAcc-mean-X` for mean values and `fBodyGyro-std-Z` for standard deviation values.

### Creating the Tidy Dataset
The final tidy dataset was created by calculating the **mean** of each variable for each **subject** and **activity** combination, resulting in a dataset with 180 rows and 68 columns. This dataset was saved as **tidy_data.txt**.
